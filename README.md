# Scout Database

The purpose of this database was to create a website where administrators, advisors, or leaders of scouts could view existing scouts, awards, and volunteers while also allowing them to add new scouts (with details such as rank, birthday, parent info), add new volunteers (volunteer information and associating them as merit badge counselors or parents of scouts), and also tracking/marking attendance for meetings that scouts did or did not attend. This website was created to help users stay on track of their scouts while also planning based on the different queries that appear to the users.
